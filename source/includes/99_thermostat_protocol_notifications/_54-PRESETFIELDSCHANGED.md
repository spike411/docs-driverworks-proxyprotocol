## PRESET FIELDS CHANGED

Updates the  Preset FIELDS TEMPLATE that UIs display for a Preset Event. To UI comes through as `preset_fields`.  Ifthis is modified, it is possible that existing presets will have data that is not in compliance. However, a protocol driver can modify this to have new `preset_fields` which are compatible. Do not delete this as Events are erased when presets are deleted.
